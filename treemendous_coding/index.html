  <h1>Welcome to <strong>Treemendous</strong></h1>
  <h2>Where we make pens and pencils out of locally sourced wood</h2>
  <p>All of our products are crafted by hand.</p>
  <p>Our staff include Ollie Smith, Noah Finnegan, Paudie Casey and Nathan O'Brien .</p>
  <img src="newlogo.png" alt="Treemendous logo">
  <p>We get our wood the right way, from the forests near the Giant’s Grave in Dungourney.</p>
  <p>Because it's local, we cut down on waste, help out our neighbors, and give old or fallen trees a second chance.</p>
  <p>Every pen and pencil has a history, a connection to the land it came from, making every one unique</p>
