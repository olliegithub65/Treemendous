  <h1>Welcome to <strong>Treemendous</strong></h1>
  <h2>Where we make pens and pencils out of locally sourced wood</h2>
  <p>Quick question—how many pens or pencils have you owned that you just didn’t care about? Seriously, think about it. All that cheap plastic, the ones you lose or break without a second thought. You grab another, and the cycle just keeps going.

But picture this: you pick up a pen or pencil that actually matters. Ours are handmade from real wood—no assembly line, no rush, nothing disposable about them. Each one has its own grain, its own quirks, a story that’s all its own. They’re as unique as you are.

When you grab one of these, you’re not just getting something to write with. You’re getting real craftsmanship. You’re choosing something thoughtful, built by real hands, not stamped out by a machine.

Wood feels different. It’s warm. There’s a life to it. It connects you back to nature in a world that’s drowning in plastic and throwaway junk. This is the kind of pen or pencil you actually want to hold onto. It’s solid, balanced, and it just feels right.

Let’s be honest—this is about impact, too. Picking handmade wood over plastic is about caring where your stuff comes from. It’s about supporting people, not just factories. It’s about quality, not just convenience.

This is the pen you reach for when you sign something that matters. The pencil you use to sketch out ideas that aren’t just passing thoughts. It’s the gift you give when you want to show someone you mean it.

So really, the question isn’t why you’d buy this pen or pencil. The real question is—why keep settling for something forgettable when you could have something meaningful?

Go for craftsmanship. Go for sustainability. Go for something made with a purpose.
